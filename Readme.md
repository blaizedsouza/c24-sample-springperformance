Building for Performance with Spring Integration & Spring Batch
===============================================================

This directory contains the slides and code used during my SpringOne2gx 2012 presentation in Washington, DC.

The code consists of 2 projects:

* SiPerformanceTests. These are the basic tests used to profile the core Spring Integration components.

* c24-springone-retail-demo. This is the receipt parsing demonstration I used to tune an SI flow with increasing file volumes and size.


Both projects can be imported into SpringSource Tool Suite (STS) or Eclipse as an existing Java project (General -> Existing Projects into Workspace).
All tests can be run by clicking on the relevant Java file and selecting Run As -> Java Application

Please see the Readme.md in the individual projects for more information.
